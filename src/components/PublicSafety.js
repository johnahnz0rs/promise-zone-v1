                            <h2>Public Safety</h2>

                            <p>The welfare and protection of LAPZ residents are important aspects in the work of the Los Angeles Promise Zone. LAPZ residents experience public safety incidents such as crime and traffic collisions more frequently compared to the rest of Los Angeles.</p>
                            <p>For instance, in 2012, the Promise Zoneâ€™s Part 1 violent crime rate was over twice the City-wide rate, according to data provide by LA Police Department and using Census 2010 population numbers.</p>
                            <p>The Promise Zone goals and objectives related to public safety expand upon the collaborative partnerships and work established by YPI with federal support through the BYRNE Criminal Justice Innovation Grant, focusing on strategies that promote community policing and resident engagement approaches.</p>
                            <p>The three measures the Promise Zone tracks to measure the public safety climate within the Zone are meant to illustrate a non-conventional understanding of public safety.</p>
