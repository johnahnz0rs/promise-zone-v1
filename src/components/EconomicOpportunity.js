                            <h2>Economic Opportunity</h2>

                            <p>Improved educational outcomes, public safety, and community sustainability closely connect to the economic health of households and businesses in the Los Angeles Promise Zone.</p>
                            <p>With 25% of Promise Zone households earning less than $15,000 a year, the PZ strives to increase accessible, quality employment opportunities as well as financial literacy among its residents.</p>
                            <p>These efforts align with strengthening the numerous small businesses in and around the Zone where over half of workers in the PZ are employed.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the initiative aims to emphasize the rich cultural treasures that each community has to offer, drawing the attention of consumers and investors alike.</p>
                            <p>The three metrics used by the Promise Zone to measure economic opportunity include:</p>

                            <ol className="">

                                    <h5>Federal Poverty Line</h5>
                                    <p>Percentage of households earning income below the federal poverty line, based on American Community Survey data. The ACS determines poverty status by comparing a householdâ€™s gross cash income against a threshold of three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963. This threshold is updated annually for inflation and adjusted for family size, composition, and age of the head of household.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
